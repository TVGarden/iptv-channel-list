# IPTV Channel Lists

## Overview
This repository, **iptv-channel-list**, includes JSON files categorizing various TV channels. These categories align with those used by iptv-org and encompass channels sourced from iptv-org. An additional custom category called 'top-news.json' features well-known English news channels.

## Structure
The channel list files are stored in the `channel-lists` folder. Each file is named according to the category it represents and contains channels relevant to that category. For example:
- `channel-lists/news.json` for news channels.
- `channel-lists/sports.json` for sports channels.
- `channel-lists/entertainment.json` for entertainment channels.
